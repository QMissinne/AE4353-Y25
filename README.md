## About
This repository contains all the resources for the weekly exercises and competitions associated with the course. Each week, exercises and their solutions will be published here.

To ensure a consistent and easy-to-setup coding environment for everyone, we will be using a combination of [Virtual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). These will be the official environments throughout the course.

To get started, please refer to this README file for detailed instructions and guidance on setting up your environment correctly. Once your environment is configured, you can begin exploring the code and working on the exercises. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out. Happy coding and learning! üåü

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

These are the required tools for this course. Please make sure to install them before starting the exercises.

#### [1. Virtual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight and powerful code editor. We will use it for writing and editing code during the course.  

- [Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)

#### [2. Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main)

Anaconda is a distribution of Python that makes it easy to manage packages ande nvironments. It ensures everyone works with the same dependencies and setup. For this course we will use Miniconda (The primary difference is that Anaconda comes with pre-installed packages, however since we are creating our own environment, we will have a fixed set of packages ready to be installed).

- [Install](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install)
- [Documentation](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/main)


#### [3. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) - <span style="color:red;"> (windows only)

WSL2 allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows. This provides a more consistent development environment for the course. If you are working on Linux, there is no need for you to install this. 

- [Install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- [(online) Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)

### GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that helps you write code faster and more efficiently. It provides intelligent code suggestions and completions based on your context, enhancing your coding experience and boosting productivity. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è We encourage you to use tools like this to aid in learning concepts and practicing coding. However, it‚Äôs important not to rely solely on these tools ‚Äî ensure you put in the effort to understand and practice the material yourself! Please note that such tools will ***NOT*** be permitted during the final exam.

If you do not have it yet, please sign up for the Student Developer Pack on GitHub using this [link](https://education.github.com/pack). Once you have signed up, wait for GitHub to authenticate your request. Once authenticated, you will have access to GitHub Copilot.

If you already have access to GitHub Copilot, it comes pre-installed when you open the devcontainer. Simply log in with your GitHub account and you can start using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.
